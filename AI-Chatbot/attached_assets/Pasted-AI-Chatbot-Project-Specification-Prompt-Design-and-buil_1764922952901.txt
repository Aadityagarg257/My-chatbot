Few things I like to change and discuss,that are mentioned in this prompt 
I add a subscription based system in it don't over advertise it and make 200 questions into 100 chats ,a user may able to make chats upto 100 and then need to pay ₹99 to able to make unlimited chats , don't over advertise this paying system and discuss few things that u want if needed
I expect it me similar to chatgpt and perplexity, make both mobile based and desktop based at one time and don't follow the phase pattern make the app in one go
